# Compact Beamspring controller.

This controller only supports new style card edge connectors only, and it requires the side
of the card edge connector to be cut off, and the pins be bent 90 degress.

This is a variant of the controller that also includes an additional expansion header, designed
especially for 3278 A02 / 3279 2C keyboards with a top panel, sporting additional leds and
non-capacitive push buttons.
See https://github.com/purdeaandrei/CompactBeamSpring/issues/1 for some details about these keyboards.
